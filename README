A driver for the Microbotics Midg II GPS/IMU sensor.  This driver was plucked from the larger
Jomegratron_IGVC package, available from here at this writing:


https://github.com/MST-Robotics/Jomegatron_IGVC


The launch file will spawn three topics, Imu, fix and Midg.  Imu and fix are standard ROS 
sensor message format, while Midg is not.  Note that the output from Imu has been
transformed as per REP 103 (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html#id7) to comply with
standard ROS convention.
